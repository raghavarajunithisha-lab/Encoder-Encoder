would you guys be interested in a podcast about loneliness i often see interest in discord servers for loneliness but how about a podcast i have experience in creating shows so it would be a high quality one but would also be authentic and non corporate there are a few such podcasts already but they are kind of corporate and limited series my idea for the show would be 1 3 monologue shows with me covering different topics about loneliness 1 3 interviews with experts or personalities 1 3 interviews with average people who are lonely i would not just focus on potential solutions to loneliness but also just produce with the goal of providing solidarity in mind another option is to do a youtube channel but it would have to be less in depth please let me know your thoughts because i m stretched pretty thin but would like to do it if there s interest i think there would be nothing sadder than a podcast about loneliness that no one listens to so i d like to gauge interest before i proceed,"loneliness, sadness"

accepting loneliness so i am currently in high school going into junior year i ve been dealing with loneliness all my life at first in freshman year i thought that i needed to find a group to be a part of and felt like being lonely was a bad thing but then my mental health went down the drain and for sophomore year i was sent to a residential facility in provo utah i was there from august early april at that place i met a lot of cool people and it was the most friends i ever had but after i got out my loneliness came back because most of them live in la and i live in the south bay area six hour drive after that i kinda just accepted loneliness because it s not worth messing yourself up just for friends in high school which you ll probably never talk to again once high school finishes it gave me a lot of time to focus on my goals in life and make myself a better person so for all those people that feel like crap for being lonely know that there are plus sides to loneliness as well,loneliness

suicidal thoughts are getting more common lately i don t think i ever experienced this before but since last year i d been having more suicidal thoughts my mind is trying to be humorous of it but i find it really disturbing my most recent memory started with planning out how to save money for something i want and hoping i d find a job that pays enough for my needs and wants then it escalated to feelings of inadequacy that i can t find a good job because i m this and that then i felt hatred for the system and my mind just told me to slash my neck i find it disturbing since my usual approach to these kind of problems would be to persevere but recently these thoughts are popping inside my head and it s beginning to worry me i read somewhere that i should find help before it gets heavier that s why i m venting this one out,"suicide intent, hopelessness, brain dysfunction (forget), worthlessness"

different take on loneliness i ve been lonely for quite some time 30yo some other social categories that predispose me for loneliness and i wonder if anyone else here has noticed the sense of freedom that comes from not being tied to a group of people or a partner recently joined the military at a later age so of course i m surrounded by these wholesome couples that are allegedly so great but as i m here longer i notice the lack of sincerity that comes with these partnerships and peer groups of course there are a few that have really made the dream work but for the most part it s people surrounded by a lot of people with issues so i m curious if anyone had at least noticed or acknowledged the benefit of being on your own tldr does anyone else with exposure to different groups of people acknowledge the advantages or how pleasant it can be to be alone,"loneliness, emptiness"

i finally understood why i prefer to stay up at night its not just insomnia it s not sleep apnea just nightmares or the silence i stay up at night because i m hypervigilant all the time and being alone awake at night triggers my alertness so much i m unable to sleep without medication of course when i eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything but it s better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me i was terrorised by a babysitter as a kid and i lived in rough neighborhoods for four years those factors plus my other child abuse and depression is what i think truly triggers this now,"sadness, loneliness"

people only care about mental illnesses that are cute quiet and make it easy to pity you do you agree when my only diagnosis was depression and anxiety i was easily pitied and white knighted either by boys who thought being suicidal and helpless was sexy or with half assed attempts from mental health workers volunteers well my bpd symptoms got worse instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didn t mention bpd symptoms i see it constantly no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic etc people will advocate when you re all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression it s completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned this is why i am so afraid of having bpd but that s beside the point i was wondering if you guys had any experience with this phenomenon,"anger, worthlessness"

helpful therapist vs nice therapist what s the difference and how to spot it so since april 2022 i m seeing my first therapist because of social phobia and depression i really like him and i m very glad i ended up with him and that i feel comfortable but know i m questioning myself if he s just nice or actually helpful do you know what i mean like he is a great person and all but what if he isn t actually helping me the only odd thing i can point out is that he often tells me that my social phobia could get better if im getting more independent moving out getting a job etc which is very hard to impossible for me why do i find this odd because ofc this should be a goal for me but to reach this goal i need to overcome my social phobia and depress it s not possible to solve an issue with the goal itself he also believes that i don t need medical treatment although i do believe that and am taking however can u explain how i spot if he s a nice or a helpful therapist,sadness
it s crippling at this point i can t even study i just keep irrationally envisioning being left out ignored alienated forgotten i used to be liked people would call me text me ask to see me what happened,"brain dysfunction (forget), loneliness, hopelessness, sadness, worthlessness, emptiness"

25m be stronger and stop thinking about others i realized that no matter how painful life is you can only depend on yourself in the end maybe some people will care and will give you some time but nobody will try to hold your hand when you will fall life is painful yes and people will ghost and leave you when you need them the most for them it doesn t matter what happens to you sometimes in the end you deal with your own problems so stop waiting for someone to help you someone to stop you from being lonely looking for a partner is not a solution for your depression you can trust people but never 100 even if it does sound harsh you have no idea when that person will leave you this is what i had to face and it s my opinion just be strong and don t always depend on someone for your happiness,"loneliness, sadness, brain dysfunction (forget), anger, hopelessness, emptiness"

loneliness here s to being lonely i say that because despite its crushing feeling at the best of times it makes me aware of what others may be suffering through it makes us go the extra effort to make sure that our peers always know they re loved and wanted we are there when people need us gone if they don t very few remember we exist other than when they see us out or at the things we may or may not attend we love more hug tighter cherish a persons attention and time cause we know what its like to feel abandoned alone and miserable in silence being lonely may suck big time but it gives great insight on how to care for others as few may do it for us,"loneliness, emptiness, sadness, worthlessness"

does anyone else crave affection on a whole other level no dad until i guess quite recently my abusive mother would make me hug her post beatings just for her own selfish justifications so feeling safe in a hug is a huge thing for me im convinced my lack of affection is what causes most of my anxiety because being left alone with no attention and feeling forgotten about was a huge thing when i was a child so i guess i feel the same now which is why it s bringing back all the memories of being locked in the corridor for hours on end weeks at a time it definitely sounds sad and pathetic to people who haven t been through this type of trauma but i definitely believe the lack of affection i ve received is sending me into a state of alarm because i m scared to be forgotten about again idek why i typed this but i guess it helps to organise my thoughts,"sadness, emptiness, loneliness, brain dysfunction (forget)"

do they come back after falling out of love with you hi so my bf m33 of almost a year now went into a depressive episode for the second time in our relationship he s going to therapy and considering meds they were not recommended to him at the moment but he acts more and more distant for the past month and is considering breaking up with me it is of course absolutely devastating for me because i love him to bits and now i watch someone who just a month ago was madly in love with me totally fall out of it so my question is do you think the love will reignite once the episode passes right now i can say with confidence he does not love me anymore but he still did just a month ago before the depression started so i am still hoping it will come back all replies are very appreciated,sadness

loneliness vs solitude i want you guys to debate about a stoicist opinion on the topic in order to find solutions to this problem if you are familiar with filosophy and stoicism feel free to enlighten us v perhaps i m even getting stoicism wrong lol questions on debate should we feel comfortable in our loneliness is loneliness just a rather common part of human nature that we struggle to accept what would you do if you lived in a world with no people and loneliness were to be a part of your nature perhaps if there is no solution to loneliness what is the next step what would we have to learn from loneliness in order to accommodate ourselves to a happy life hell what would a zen monk do in this case,loneliness

are parents allowed to touch you this is a bit embarrassing and i also don t know if this is the right sub to ask this basically my mother always touches me like it s her right because she gave birth to me that s at least her reasoning she knows that i hate being touched but she does it anyways even though i always tell her to not touch me she even touches my breasts and butt sometimes she mostly does it to show me that i gained weight i m in the normal weight range close to underweight so there s no need for her to worry which makes me feel terrible about myself but she acts hurt when i tell her that i don t want to be touched she even laughs about my discomfort sometimes and makes fun of me for visibly showing it she isn t even a touchy person in general she just likes to touch me idk what to do at this point anymore telling her not to touch me doesn t help at all and she makes me feel like i m overreacting,"sadness, hopelessness, worthlessness"

how do i stop trauma dumping how do i stop trauma dumping to everyone i have a very bad habit of somehow trying to get closer to people and connect with other by trauma dumping i am not here to complain or say someone else did me dirty or it s someone else s fault but it is simply my fault i do this far too often i know it is wrong i know i shouldn t do this to others without asking for their consent but sometimes when you get so low and alone it seems like it is your only choice how can i go about getting myself better i realize the first step is acknowledging that i do this what is my next step i guess stop trying to reach out to others or ask them first if they have a chance to talk,loneliness
advice for anyone who has been backstabbed by their partner and found out about it if your partner apologised for doing you dirty behind your back and tried convincing you to forgive them by promising you that they won t do it again just remember that they would not have stopped or been sorry if you did not find out i m talking about the very obvious things that they know will would you my bf soon to be ex and i shared a few mutual friends and he created a wedge between me and all of them by talking nastily about me to them in addition he s also isolated me from all my other friends too anyway when i found out what he was up to and said i m done with the relationship he apologised profusely and said he d never let me down again fast forward 2 months he was doing it again and threatened to commit suicide if i left him moral of the story they aren t sorry if they didn t stop on their own and secondly leave the relationship when you notice the first red flag,"suicide intent, sadness"
my only goal in life is to earn enough money to repay my parents then kill myself don t get me wrong my parents are good too good i have had a good life better than i deserve i may be young but i know that i am going nowhere i have no dreams no goals nothing one day i just lost the will to live and just distracted myself with books and short term goals i studied hard and worked hard competed in inter school competitions and such only to get a feeling of dread at the new expectations instead of joy at my success i still hope its a phase but its been 5 years now and if the rest of my life is going to be like this might as well end it early i never had friends and intentionally distance myself to people i know that i will never get a relationship i know that if i did get a relationship i will ruin it i can just see my life being a trainwreck and just wish i can get out,"suicide intent, loneliness, hopelessness, sadness, emptiness, anger, worthlessness"

i keep thinking about how my life could have been if i was able to actually live it one of the things that i think about constantly is how i could be such a great artist today if i managed to continue drawing i have great skills and they could have flourished but i just can t move myself to draw even a stick man i m a very creative person and my head is always filled with a bunch of thoughts i also just love art so much and i have such a hard time trying to express myself i feel like drawing could help me so much and make me so happy and proud but i can barely do shit and the only energy i have to get things done is spent on my law school i should probably be worrying about how i haven t showered in a week but the fact that just never tried harder to get better at drawing makes me so mad at myself and that is only one of the things i was and still am unable to do there are so many others i hate how i m just rotting away,"anger, hopelessness, sadness, worthlessness"
i want to be anybody but myself i hate having adhd and shit memory and feeling like an imbecile everytime i open my mouth if i could at least be beautiful it would make up for the fact that i am a moron but i am also cursed in the looks department and would have to pay tens of thousands of dollars on risky plastic surgery to look even half decent the only thing i can do at this point is be a kind person and i don t do a great job at that but even then i am too hollow for anyone to willingly spend more than a few months around me before they conclude that i am disposable and that they could easily find someone better off the street i hate myself for being self centered and overly concerned with trivial matters that are tied to my ego as opposed to worrying about actual problems that need to be solved,"emptiness, brain dysfunction (forget), hopelessness, worthlessness, sadness, anger, loneliness"

i wish more people understood depression is nothing like sadness depression is a void that eats at you slowly something that creeps up on you the second you re not distracted a numbness feelings don t stick around no matter how enjoyable they are and the gaps between them feel immeasurable it s a constant regret of the past and dread of the coming you want everyone and nothing you want to be happy and yet you also just want it to all go away and stay away the worst part is when you still manage to function you get up and eat and drink and work and chat but at night you feel that numbness the craving for something other than this emptiness slowly carving away from the inside out too slow to notice by eye without a timelapse more people would realize they have depression and less people would misuse the word depression and less people would be harsh to depressed people because they view it as just being a little sad if only,"emptiness, hopelessness"

been thinking a lot about manifestation and what a sick joke that can be for people like us the idea that your life is based on your thoughts my thoughts are fucking terrible the idea that our thoughts are responsible for the good and bad things that happen in life feels like such a slap in the face because it assumes that we are always in control of what we think goes hand in hand with just move on the past is the past of course you feel bad when you dwell also manifestation can bring into question whether my thoughts caused my trauma and that goes deeper into more feelings of blame and guilt maybe manifestation works well for some people but it just feels shitty when so many people carry this belief that we are in total control we aren t in control if we were i don t think ptsd and so many other conditions would exist,worthlessness

have you ever considered that being lonely might be the role you were meant to play everything has its opposite right good and evil night and day hot and cold up and down in order for someone to be happy that must mean that someone else has to be sad how could happiness exist otherwise for two people to be in love there must be a handful of people that each person rejected in that case it s probably reasonable to assume that for every person that found love 5 others lost it of course life is fluid it doesn t mean that you will always have to be the one that s lonely however loneliness can never be completely eradicated nor should it be even if we somehow could sounds like a nightmare but ultimately loneliness is a burden that must be carried by someone,"loneliness, sadness, worthlessness"

how to deal with anxiety triggered by criticism can i take constructive criticism generally yes however getting criticized many times over little things gives me anxiety that makes me angry because 1 i often times can t escape the feeling of anxiety when criticized 2 i try to be pretty agreeable to avoid displeasing people so when that expectation isn t met and people still criticize me i get angry and resentful because it feels like there is nothing i can do to please them which makes me feel like there is no way to get away from my anxiety i also end up feeling like a victim which makes me feel weak and disempowered which i hate this also makes me angry lol so my question is can i choose to not feel anxiety in situations like this and how if i can t just choose not to feel it how do i deal with it what is the healthy end goal that i should have if ending the feeling of anxiety isn t possible thanks everyone,anger

advice i ve seen most of the post talking abt how they feel lonely or theyre friends dont invite them anywhere you have to do something abt it because it will get worse way worse learn manipulation if ur friends dont invite u anywhere but only talk to u ignore them ignoring is one of the best thing see when someone ignores u keep thinking abt them u should do the same ignore them dont talk to them if they message u leave them on seen or delivered start going somewhere post on ig like stories that ur actually having fun they will start thinking abt u and start texting u more they will invite u anywhere and will try to come closer even if ur sad inside go out alone to the movies post on ur story if they text u leave them on seen start talking to gilrs have fake confidence and go up to the girl and talk take her out somewhere and start having fun trust life will get better if u do it learn jokes and try to make people laugh girls like when a guy makes them laugh all the time dont be needy or desperate learn manipulation best way life will get better that way,"loneliness, sadness"

no contact or phase out i have finally recognized that a dynamic that i am in is toxic and i want to end it we are just friends as of now but i m not sure if i should tell him specifically that i no longer want to be a part of his life or if i should just slowly let it die out since he s in the ignoring me phase and only giving me breadcrumbs every now and again so that i don t leave i m not sure i can deal with the subtle guilt trip in the form of him finally taking responsibility for his actions to keep me hooked it s kind of a performance that he does that echoes the way that i apologize but with more excuses and then emphasizes how much he has enjoyed being friends with me in a sullen way that makes me question whether i m overreacting or not and makes me feel guilty but ultimately does not inform how he acts in the future in the slightest,"sadness, hopelessness"

the worst feeling is when you want to cry but no tears are coming out because you got so used to just being sad everyday i m so sick of this no matter how much i try to improve myself i end up failing and disappointing everyone around me my dad is pissed off that he wasted money on me and i can t do any progrees and it s pretty clear he s ashamed of me i have a depressed face everytime i come to school or anyone else but nobody even fucking bothers to ask me if i m ok they don t care i don t want to live like this anymore it feels like my mind and soul has been trapped for 6 years and it has not developed a single bit since i want to end all this i cannot carry on living the way i am just to see things get worse for me in the future,"sadness, hopelessness, suicide intent, brain dysfunction (forget), anger, worthlessness, loneliness, emptiness"
depression erased replaced my entire personality i dont know if this happened to anyone else here but i ve been reduced to a complete blank slate i can barely even speak anymore stuttering and slurring over my words i don t have lany real hobbies anymore and any humor or wit i might have had is completely gone yes i can wrote a 100 page long essay about how depressed i am but that s it it s like my entire identity revolves around how miserable i am,"emptiness, sadness, hopelessness, brain dysfunction (forget), worthlessness"
on reddit to escape loneliness now feeling lonely on reddit i ve never really being a lurker i like to post comment interact i m a memer and that s fun but after a while i feel bad again i had my success from time to time but most of the time you post things nobody care about or openly dislike it makes you feel really disconnected and out of the loop i started making memes because i m in a moment in my life where i ve become isolated i m writing my thesis many of my friend already gradueted and moved on with their life my main group of friends i lost them a couple of years ago they weren t really good friends but they where the ones i got the last time a meme of mine reached hot i didn t feel the same pleasure adrenaline it was alright numbers raising and gaining awards didn t really felt much why am i doing this i feel a lot better the moment i talk to someone directly in a chat or when someone really opens up in the comments talking directly to me,loneliness

insensitive comment from a close friend i was on the phone with my best friend and she said she had a patient come in to the hospital that day where she works who had brutally self harmed and then said i can t believe someone her age would still self harm like that she should have grown out of that by now it really rubbed me the wrong way and i can t believe my friend would express that to me as i am someone with a past of self harming and suicidal ideation it just kind of proved to me how unsympathetic she is as a person and how little she cares to know about mental health it also got to me because being a patient in a hospital you are there for help but there are probably medical staff there judging you for your condition and talking about you to others in a negative way later this is supposed to be a safe place idk my heart is kind of broken,"sadness, anger, suicide intent, hopelessness, worthlessness"

mental illness can be comfortable when it comes to mental illness recovery we don t talk enough about leaving the comfort of sadness and then when we try to get better it starts feeling uncomfortable to discover who we are outside of this sadness that has felt like a fundamental part of us for years you ve been practically nested in this sadness so your brain naturally tries to take you back to this state yet emotions feelings and physical states are fluid yes they are part of us but they do not define us still we let it define us because it feels so comfortable therefore the real challenge is to find yourself outside of this sadness who did you used to be who can you be,sadness

i ve been dealing with severe depression for about 5 years now ever since me and my wife separated it s been a rather traumatic experience for me having to leave my kids behind i ve been going to several support groups for many different reasons and taking psych meds for my depression and anxiety and they seem to be slowly helping but i still find myself feeling stuck or slowly descending back into that pit of despair i do my best to keep from falling but i still do fromm time to time when my thoughts start to become chaotic and crazy usually when i m alone which is most of the time to help me cope with these feelings i go for a walk or try to find something to do to keep my mind occupied and busy but it doesn t always work but i m still depressed and become anxious at times and i can feel alone even in a crowd of people which triggers my anxiety very high i can t stand large groups of people especially in confined spaces it freaks me out but oddly i also get anxious when i m alone so i m anxious almost all the time except when around just a few people at a time then i feel pretty comfortable,"loneliness, hopelessness, brain dysfunction (forget)"

feeling like nobody will ever truly understand you being with someone makes me feel just as lonely as i was was alone i wish you d prioritize me the same way i would for you i could spend countless hours and days with you forever but it isn t the same for you i wish i could meet someone who would truly love and understand me and feel what i feel for them maybe we re not right for each other but i m too scared to be alone alone but i love you so much but i can t force you to feel the same why is it so hard sometimes,"loneliness, sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, worthlessness"
for all the lonely and sad people out there you are worthy of love and friendship no matter what we think of ourselves no matter what causes your sadness and loneliness life can still be ok it doesn t need to be be amazing like how the shows portray them i realized that shows and movies have given lots of people hyper realistic but not real expectations of love and friendship nobody in general have love stories like the disney or hallmark movies or even expectacular friendships where you have these group of friends where you can talk about anything like the big bang theory maybe that s why it drives our longing and want for such feelings and belongings this might be a phase or a long term suffering but i hope that you can weave through life and finally find someone nice a significant other or just a friend who will listen the journey will be tough treacherous and full of uncertainties but you can figure it out if you try your best think of it as a quest i see you and wish you the best,"sadness, loneliness"

does depression make you not want anything i don t really mean lack of ability to enjoy things you used to enjoy because that s more down to being taught over and over that you need to be productive not waste time on anything that doesn t matter part of this is due to scarcity of free time meaning that nothing is worth my very little time i definitely have that i don t really enjoy anything what i m actually wondering and maybe this is the other side of the same coin is does depression make you just not want anything anymore all i need is more money i guess and once i have enough to be self sufficient there won t be a need for that though that can t really ever be achieved probably but besides that i don t want anything nothing really sounds worthwhile it s all just consumption that makes the world more polluted i don t really want to do more work but i also just want to sit in a chair and literally do nothing to just let my mind hum away with no purpose is that just depression,"worthlessness, emptiness, hopelessness, sadness"
